README for Ghilbert prototype

Here is a prototype of the Ghilbert implementation.

You can use the batch verifier as follows:

python verify.py peano/peano_thms.gh

You can run the web app locally by installing the appengine SDK and running:

dev_appserver.py .

Then navigating to http://localhost:8080/edit/thmname

Save the proof by pressing Ctrl-S, then navigating to:

http://localhost:8080/recent

The interactive proof tool is, at present, extremly rough.

For more details, see http://ghilbert.googlecode.com/

Note: the App Engine server is currently using the Python 2.5 runtime
and webapp2. This seems to work ok in the dev server, but to push to a
live App Engine instance, you probably want to include webapp2.py and
the webapp2_extras subdir from the webapp2 distribution before updating.
This is a temporary situation until the upgrade to 2.7 is complete.
