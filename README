Here is a prototype of the Ghilbert implementation.

You can use the batch verifier as follows:

python verify.py peano/peano_thms.gh

You can run the web app locally by running:

dev_appserver.py .

Then navigating to http://localhost:8080/edit/thmname

Save the proof by pressing Ctrl-S, then navigating to:

http://localhost:8080/recent

The interactive proof tool is, at present, extremly rough.

For more details, see http://ghilbert.googlecode.com/
